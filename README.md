# Plasma Donor Application

### Software Required:

        Python, Flask , Docker

### Project Description:

        During the COVID 19 crisis, the requirement of plasma became a high priority
        and the donor count has become low. 
        
        Saving the donor information and helping the needy by notifying the current
        donors list, would be a helping hand. 
        
        In regard to the problem faced, an application is to be built which would take
        the donor details, store them and inform them upon a request.
